# Simulated Data Description

Each pair of CSVs represents X and Y tracks from simulated models of biological motion. 

Simulations were generated with [Heteromotility](https://github.com/cellgeometry/heteromotility/).

Filename | Simulation Type
---------|----------------
brw | Biased Random Walks (*bias = 0.7*)
fbm | Fractal Brownian Motion (*H = 0.9*)
pf | Power Flier (*alpha = 2*)
rw | Random Walk (unbiased)
